This directory contains the code for the frontend service of the application, which displays a nice UI in a web browser for the user to interact with. Users are able to type out their sentences and get sentiment predictions for their sentences.

## Start-up the UI service WITH DOCKER
1. Run `docker build <docker_repo_name>/<tag> .` to build the Docker image. The `Dockerfile` contains the instructions for building the Docker image.
2. Run `docker images` to find the Docker image ID for the image you just built.
3. Run `docker run -d -p 8001:8001 --name=sentiment-anlysis-frontend <docker_image_ID>`.
	1. The frontend service will start up in the background on [http://0.0.0.0:8001/](http://0.0.0.0:8001/), so you should see UI when you visit that page. 
	2. __IMPORTANT:__ When you start up the UI service this way, you are not coupling it to the ML service, even if the ML service is running. You will get an error message that says the UI could not connect to the ML service because the _localhost_ inside of a Docker container is not the same _localhost_ as your computer. You must use `docker-compose` to bring up both services together and couple them.
4. Stop the container using `docker stop <container_ID>` and remove it using `docker rm <container_ID>`.

## Start-up the UI service WITHOUT DOCKER
1. Use the the `sentiment_analysis_ui_env.yaml` file in this directory to create a Conda environment and start it.
	1. Run `conda env create -f sentiment_analysis_ui_env.yaml`.
	2. Run `conda activate sentiment_analysis_ui_env` to start the Conda environment.
2. Install the project by running `pip install -e .`. This will allow all of the modules for this part of the application to be imported correctly.
3. Test that this backend application can be run properly using `pytest`.
	1. Run `pytest -v` from this directory. This will test the application using the tests contained in the `tests/` directory.
	2. At the bottom of your Terminal screen, you should see `3 passed`, indicating that the app should work correctly.
4. Start up the application locally:
	1. From the root directory, execute `chmod +x run.sh`. This shell script will start up a Gunicorn server that runs the Flask application.
	2. From the root directory, execute `./run.sh`.
	3. The app will start up on [http://0.0.0.0:8001/](http://0.0.0.0:8001/), which is the home page. A user can input a sentence in the provided text box and click _Submit_ to get a sentiment score for the given sentence.
	4. __IMPORTANT:__ A sentiment score will only be returned if the ML service is running (in a Docker container or just locally). If the ML service is not running, you should see a message that says "Could not connect to 'http://0.0.0:8000/predict'." 


## Folder Descriptions
1. `logs`: Contains different _.log_ files that provide information on how a user interacted with the application and any errors that occurred.
	1. The `logging.yaml` file specifies configurations for the logger used by the Flask application.

2. `static`: Contains the CSS and JavaScript code for the GUI component of the application.
3. `templates`: Contains the Jinja templates that are served as part of the GUI.
	1. `base.html` is the base template that `index.html` and `after_prediction.html` build off of.
	2. The HTML, CSS and JavaScript code was adapted from the _Eventually_ design by [HTML5 UP](html5up.net).
4. `tests/`: Contains test files for testing the frontend application.
5. `ui_api`: Contains files implementing the frontend API of the service.
	1. `ui_blueprint.py` contains a Flask Blueprint that details which endpoints are served and how they are served.
6. `utils`: Contains code and functions that can be shared.
	1. `initialize_logging.py`: Starts up the logger with the proper configurations.
	2. `load_yaml`: Reads in the configuration details from a YAML file.
